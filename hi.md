# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository houses a comprehensive Wine Quality Prediction system based on machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build models capable of predicting the quality of wines based on various physicochemical features.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, scaling, and exploring the dataset to prepare it for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing relationships, distributions, and correlations within the wine dataset to gain insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Regression to predict wine quality.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models for better accuracy using techniques like grid search or random search.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Discussing potential deployment options or considerations for integrating the model into a production environment.

## Dataset
